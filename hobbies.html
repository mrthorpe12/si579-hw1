            <li class="main-point">Travel</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I've visited most of the contiguous U.S. and have been to Spain, France, Italy, and the UK. At some
                    point in the near future, I'd like to travel to Russia, since I studied Russian as an undergrad!
                </li>
                <li>Favorite state: Montana. Reason: I enjoy the outdoors, and Montana has a lot of outdoors to offer.
                    Highly recommend Glacier National Park if you're interested in hiking, fishing, camping, or winter
                    sports!</li>
                <li>Favorite city: Sevilla, Spain. Reason: Fascinating culture and awesome people. Sevilla is a great place to
                    experience Spanish culture firsthand, and the area's history is amazing.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="main-point">Music</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Played the string bass throughout middle and high school. Was chosen to attend the Missouri All-State
                    Orchestra twice (2015 and 2016).</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="main-point">Sports</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Football: Diehard Packers fan (my family is originally from Wisconsin).</li>
                <li>Baseball: Enjoy watching the St. Louis Cardinals.</li>
                <li>Started practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu this summer. Really enjoy it as a sport and would recommend
                    it to anyone who's interested!</li>
